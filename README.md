roguelike
=========
David creates a roguelike in Processing.

##About
This is an open source game made by [davesoon](https://github.com/davesoon).  
Right now, the work is still untitled and in pre-Alpha stages.  
Hopefully the finished work will be a dungeon crawler with some basic(?) plot.  
  
  
##Playing
"Hey, Dave, I want to play this awesome game!"  
Good for you. Sooner or later, I will have complete builds in the folder.  
If you want to play the latest (bug ridden) version:  
  
1. Download Github
2. Download [Processing](https://processing.org)
3. Fork this to your own account
4. Run the repo from Processing  
*Please note that this may damage your saves.*  
*Please note that I have not added saving yet.*  

##Future Features

AKA Stuff I want to make in the long term:  
  
1. Add various dungeon generators
2. Make an overworld
  - This will contain shops and stuff that will reward you for exploring
3. Randomly generated items  

Keep in mind that these are always up for debate and may change.
